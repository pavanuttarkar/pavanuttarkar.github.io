     abstract = "{We present the first results from a new backend on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Commensal Realtime ASKAP Fast Transient COherent (CRACO) upgrade. CRACO records millisecond time resolution visibility data, and searches for dispersed fast transient signals including fast radio bursts (FRB), pulsars, and ultra-long period objects (ULPO). With the visibility data, CRACO can localise the transient events to arcsecond-level precision after the detection. Here, we describe the CRACO system and report the result from a sky survey carried out by CRACO at 110ms resolution during its commissioning phase. During the survey, CRACO detected two FRBs (including one discovered solely with CRACO, FRB 20231027A), reported more precise localisations for four pulsars, discovered two new RRATs, and detected one known ULPO, GPM J1839-10, through its sub-pulse structure. We present a sensitivity calibration of CRACO, finding that it achieves the expected sensitivity of 11.6 Jy ms to bursts of 110 ms duration or less. CRACO is currently running at a 13.8 ms time resolution and aims at a 1.7 ms time resolution before the end of 2024. The planned CRACO has an expected sensitivity of 1.5 Jy ms to bursts of 1.7 ms duration or less, and can detect 10x more FRBs than the current CRAFT incoherent sum system (i.e., 0.5-2 localised FRBs per day), enabling us to better constrain the FRB emission mechanism model and use them as cosmological probes.}",

     abstract = "{Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short-timescale transients of extragalactic origin. The number of detected FRBs has grown dramatically since         their serendipitous discovery from archival data. Some FRBs have         also been seen to repeat. The polarimetric properties of         repeating FRBs show diverse behaviour and, at times, extreme         polarimetric morphology, suggesting a complex magneto-ionic         circumburst environment for this class of FRB. The polarimetric         properties such as circular polarisation behaviour of FRBs are         crucial for understanding their surrounding magnetic-ionic         environment. The circular polarisation previously observed in         some of the repeating FRB sources has been attributed to         propagation effects such as generalised Faraday rotation (GFR),         where conversion from linear to circular polarisation occurs due         to the non-circular modes of transmission in relativistic         plasma. The discovery burst from the repeating FRB$~$20180301A         showed significant frequency-dependent circular polarisation         behaviour, which was initially speculated to be instrumental due         to a sidelobe detection. Here we revisit the properties given         the subsequent interferometric localisation of the burst, which         indicates that the burst was detected in the primary beam of the         Parkes/Murriyang 20-cm multibeam receiver. We develop a Bayesian         Stokes-Q, U, and V fit method to model the GFR effect, which is         independent of the total polarised flux parameter. Using the GFR         model we show that the rotation measure (RM) estimated is two         orders of magnitude smaller and opposite sign ($\sim$28         rad$\,$m$^{-2}$) than the previously reported value. We         interpret the implication of the circular polarisation on its         local magnetic environment and reinterpret its long-term         temporal evolution in RM.}",

        (sub-)millisecond duration that show wide-ranging spectral,
        temporal, and polarimetric properties. The polarimetric analysis
        of FRBs can be used to probe intervening media, study the
        emission mechanism, and test possible progenitor models. In
        particular, low-frequency depolarization of FRBs can identify
        dense, turbulent, magnetized, ionized plasma thought to be near
        the FRB progenitor. An ensemble of repeating FRBs has shown low-
        frequency depolarization. The depolarization is quantified by
        the parameter $\sigma _{\rm RM}\,$, which correlates with
        proxies for both the turbulence and mean magnetic field strength
        of the putative plasma. However, while many non-repeating FRBs
        show comparable scattering (and hence inferred turbulence) to
        repeating FRBs, it is unclear whether their surrounding
        environments are comparable to those of repeating FRBs. To test
        this, we analyse the spectro-polarimetric properties of five
        one-off FRBs and one repeating FRB, detected and localized by
        the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder. We search for
        evidence of depolarization due to $\sigma _{\rm RM}\,$ and
        consider models where the depolarization is intrinsic to the
        source. We find no evidence (for or against) the sample showing
        spectral depolarization. Under the assumption that FRBs have
        multipath propagation-induced depolarization, the correlation
        between our constraint on $\sigma _{\rm RM}\,$ and RM is
        consistent with repeating FRBs only if the values of $\sigma
        _{\rm RM}\,$ are much smaller than our upper limits.
        Additionally, the correlation between the constraints on $\sigma
        _{\rm RM}\,$ and {\ensuremath{\tau}}$_{s}$ is inconsistent with
        repeating FRBs. The observations provide further evidence for
        differences in the typical environments and sources of one-off
        and repeating FRBs.}",

        increasing diversity of phenomenology has emerged. Through long-
        term multi-epoch studies of repeating FRBs, it is possible to
        assess which phenomena are common to the population and which
        are unique to individual sources. We present a multi-epoch
        monitoring campaign of the repeating FRB source 20180301A using
        the ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver observations with
        Murriyang, the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. The observations
        covered a wide frequency band spanning approximately 0.7-4 GHz,
        and yielded the detection of 46 bursts. None of the repeat
        bursts displayed radio emission in the range of 1.8-4 GHz, while
        the burst emission peaked at 1.1 GHz. We discover evidence for
        secular trends in the burst dispersion measure, indicating a
        decline at a rate of $-2.7\pm 0.2\, {\rm pc\, cm^{-3}\,
        yr^{-1}}$. We also found significant variation in the Faraday
        rotation measure of the bursts across the follow-up period,
        including evidence of a sign reversal. While a majority of
        bursts did not exhibit any polarization, those that did show a
        decrease in the linear polarization fraction as a function of
        frequency, consistent with spectral depolarization due to
        scattering, as observed in other repeating FRB sources.
        Surprisingly, no significant variation in the polarization
        position angles was found, which is in contrast with earlier
        measurements reported for the FRB source. We measure the burst
        rate and sub-pulse drift rate variation and compare them with
        the previous results. These novel observations, along with the
        extreme polarization properties observed in other repeating
        FRBs, suggest that a sub-sample of FRB progenitors possess
        highly dynamic magneto-ionic environments.}",

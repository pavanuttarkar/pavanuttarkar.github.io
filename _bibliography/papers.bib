  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

     abstract = "{Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic transients of
        (sub-)millisecond duration that show wide-ranging spectral,
        temporal, and polarimetric properties. The polarimetric analysis
        of FRBs can be used to probe intervening media, study the
        emission mechanism, and test possible progenitor models. In
        particular, low-frequency depolarization of FRBs can identify
        dense, turbulent, magnetized, ionized plasma thought to be near
        the FRB progenitor. An ensemble of repeating FRBs has shown low-
        frequency depolarization. The depolarization is quantified by
        the parameter $\sigma _{\rm RM}\,$, which correlates with
        proxies for both the turbulence and mean magnetic field strength
        of the putative plasma. However, while many non-repeating FRBs
        show comparable scattering (and hence inferred turbulence) to
        repeating FRBs, it is unclear whether their surrounding
        environments are comparable to those of repeating FRBs. To test
        this, we analyse the spectro-polarimetric properties of five
        one-off FRBs and one repeating FRB, detected and localized by
        the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder. We search for
        evidence of depolarization due to $\sigma _{\rm RM}\,$ and
        consider models where the depolarization is intrinsic to the
        source. We find no evidence (for or against) the sample showing
        spectral depolarization. Under the assumption that FRBs have
        multipath propagation-induced depolarization, the correlation
        between our constraint on $\sigma _{\rm RM}\,$ and RM is
        consistent with repeating FRBs only if the values of $\sigma
        _{\rm RM}\,$ are much smaller than our upper limits.
        Additionally, the correlation between the constraints on $\sigma
        _{\rm RM}\,$ and {\ensuremath{\tau}}$_{s}$ is inconsistent with
        repeating FRBs. The observations provide further evidence for
        differences in the typical environments and sources of one-off
        and repeating FRBs.}",

     abstract = "{As the sample size of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has grown, an
        increasing diversity of phenomenology has emerged. Through long-
        term multi-epoch studies of repeating FRBs, it is possible to
        assess which phenomena are common to the population and which
        are unique to individual sources. We present a multi-epoch
        monitoring campaign of the repeating FRB source 20180301A using
        the ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver observations with
        Murriyang, the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. The observations
        covered a wide frequency band spanning approximately 0.7-4 GHz,
        and yielded the detection of 46 bursts. None of the repeat
        bursts displayed radio emission in the range of 1.8-4 GHz, while
        the burst emission peaked at 1.1 GHz. We discover evidence for
        secular trends in the burst dispersion measure, indicating a
        decline at a rate of $-2.7\pm 0.2\, {\rm pc\, cm^{-3}\,
        yr^{-1}}$. We also found significant variation in the Faraday
        rotation measure of the bursts across the follow-up period,
        including evidence of a sign reversal. While a majority of
        bursts did not exhibit any polarization, those that did show a
        decrease in the linear polarization fraction as a function of
        frequency, consistent with spectral depolarization due to
        scattering, as observed in other repeating FRB sources.
        Surprisingly, no significant variation in the polarization
        position angles was found, which is in contrast with earlier
        measurements reported for the FRB source. We measure the burst
        rate and sub-pulse drift rate variation and compare them with
        the previous results. These novel observations, along with the
        extreme polarization properties observed in other repeating
        FRBs, suggest that a sub-sample of FRB progenitors possess
        highly dynamic magneto-ionic environments.}",
